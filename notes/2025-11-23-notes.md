# 2025-11-23 — Daily Notes

## Highlights
- Major pipeline expansion: added embeddings/attributes/parquet outputs, attractiveness model checkpoint, manual labels, and composite generator enhancements (`src/composite/composite_generator.py`, `src/attributes/face_attributes.py`, `src/embeddings/embed_clip.py`).
- Updated schematics and notebooks (training/inference/visualization) plus new repo maps and tooling docs; README substantially revised.
- Requirements refreshed to align with new tooling and data workflows; pruned redundant documentation files.

## Achievements
- End-to-end FaceStats v4 notebook set now covers preprocessing → embeddings → attributes → attractiveness modeling/inference with composites and metadata exports.
- Documentation now mirrors the expanded pipeline with updated schematics and flow diagrams.

## Challenges / Risks
- Heavy binary/data commits (models, large parquets, images) and `.DS_Store` files bloat the repo and may strain clones/deploys.
- Rapid notebook churn; limited automated validation for the composite generator and inference steps.

## Next Actions
- Move large datasets/models to external storage with tracking (e.g., DVC/artifacts) and tighten `.gitignore`.
- Add smoke tests for composite generation and attractiveness inference to catch regressions.
- Consolidate notebooks into fewer, versioned playbooks to reduce duplication.
