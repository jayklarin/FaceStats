# 2025-11-24 — Daily Notes

## Highlights
- Added `GIT_POSTMORTEM_REPORT.md` capturing recent issues/mitigations.
- Tightened tracking rules (`.gitignore`) to stop committing generated data; followed by notebook refresh after cleanup.
- Data curation: selected best 10k preprocessed images and adjusted schematics accordingly.
- Composite pipeline fix with refreshed metadata/parquet artifacts and notebook updates.

## Achievements
- Improved data quality for composites and established a postmortem record for reference.

## Challenges / Risks
- Very large binaries/parquets (e.g., attributes_with_predictions, 10k images) remain in history and inflate repo size.
- Continued `.DS_Store` and notebook churn; pipeline robustness not yet validated post-filter fix.

## Next Actions
- Offload bulky datasets/binaries to external storage (DVC/artifacts) and ensure `.gitignore` blocks future commits.
- Re-run composite pipeline on the curated 10k set and spot-check outputs.
- Reduce notebook noise and add lightweight checks for composite/metadata generation.
