# 2025-11-25 — Daily Notes

## Highlights
- Added attractiveness scoring helper (`src/attractiveness/scoring.py`) and Streamlit UI (`src/visualization/attractiveness_streamlit_v2.py`) to run CLIP → scorer → percentile/decile.
- Refreshed processed assets and checkpoint (`data/processed/metadata/attractiveness_scores.parquet`, `data/processed/attractiveness_scores.npy`, `src/models/attractiveness_regressor.pt`) plus new single-image scoring notebook.
- Updated deploy environment: `python-3.11` runtime and pinned `requirements.txt` with torch CPU wheels and Streamlit/Transformers versions.

## Achievements
- End-to-end attractiveness workflow now works interactively from upload to score with percentile/decile readout and reusable save helpers.

## Challenges / Risks
- Multiple dependency tweaks suggest runtime compatibility tuning; CPU-only torch+transformers stack may still be heavy for Streamlit Cloud.
- Large binaries and committed temp/cache files (`data/processed/...`, `src/__pycache__/*`, `data/processed/composites/upload_tmp.jpg`) increase repo size; consider cleanup/ignore.

## Next Actions
- Clean temp/cache artifacts and add ignore rules.
- Smoke-test Streamlit deploy against new requirements.
- Trim or relocate bulky processed datasets if size becomes an issue.
