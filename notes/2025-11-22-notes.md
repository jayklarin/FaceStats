# 2025-11-22 — Daily Notes

## Highlights
- Added landscape Mermaid tool diagram and expanded schematics.
- Built out preprocessing/embedding/attribute pipelines with new notebooks and modules (`src/attributes/age_infer.py`, `src/embeddings/embed_clip.py`, data utils) and refreshed visualization app.
- Generated initial processed datasets (embeddings, attributes, metadata flags/clusters) and updated requirements for the new stack.
- Removed older inference/training pipeline code in favor of the new structure.

## Achievements
- Established the first full pass of data preparation (preprocess → CLIP embeddings → attribute extraction) with companion notebooks and code.

## Challenges / Risks
- Large processed datasets and `.DS_Store` files committed, increasing repo size; pipeline deletions may break prior entry points until downstream code is updated.
- No automated checks around the new data artifacts; risk of silent schema drift.

## Next Actions
- Add gitignore rules and external storage for bulky artifacts; keep repos lean.
- Validate that downstream consumers align with the new pipeline structure and APIs.
- Introduce basic validation scripts for generated parquet/embedding outputs.
