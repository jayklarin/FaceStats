## Highlights
- Bootstrapped the repository (initial commit) with README and baseline requirements.
- Added learning curve visualization module and supporting README updates.

## Achievements
- Established project scaffolding with documented intent and initial tooling for model evaluation visuals.

## Challenges / Risks
- No CI/tests yet; requirements may evolve as pipelines are added.

## Next Actions
- Add `.gitignore`, lint/test scaffolding, and CI basics.
- Define data storage strategy early (artifacts vs. source control) to avoid repo bloat.
